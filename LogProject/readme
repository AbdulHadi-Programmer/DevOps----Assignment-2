# Log File Analyzer :

*"**$#**" → How many things (arguments) the user typed after the script.*
*"**-ne 1**" → "Not equal to 1" (we want exactly one argument: the log file).*
*"**$0**" → The script name.*
*"**exit 1**" → Quit the script if wrong input.*

log_file="$1"

* "**$1**" → First argument (the file name).*
* "**log_file=...**" → Store it in a variable called log_file.*

# File Exists? 
if [ ! -f "$log_file" ]; then 
    echo "Error: File $log_file does not exist"
    exit 1
fi 

- *[ ! -f ... ]* → "If not a file..."
- *exit 1* → Quit with an error.

# 📅 Timestamped Report Name
timestamp=$(date+"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
report_file="log_file_${timestamp}.txt"

- *date +...* → Gets the current time: 20250721_043742
- *${timestamp}* → Plug in the time to name the file.
➡️ Now the report file is like: log_analysis_20250721_043742.txt
